Things to do

Functional requirements
The functional requirements for the embedded plant watering system are:
    a) The water pump must be controllable
    b) The described sensors must be readable
    c) The wireless remote functionality must be accessible
    d) The water pump must run once at an interval of 12 hours.
    e) The water pump must additionally run maximum once per hour if the soil moisture falls below a certain threshold
    f) The water pump must run once if the farmer presses the button once within a period of two seconds.
    g) In case of an active pump water alarm or a plant water alarm the water pump may not run under any circumstances.
    h) The wireless remote must light the red LED in case of a pump water alarm or plant water alarm.
    i) The wireless remote must light the yellow LED in case the soil moisture is below a certain threshold
    j) The wireless remote must light the green LED otherwise
    k) The RPi must provide web access to historical information about soil moisture, ambient light, 
       pump activations and water alarms. The data should be available as both graphs and downloadable data
    l) The RPi must be able to function both with and without an active internet connection via the RPi ethernet port
    m) The RPi must become fully operational after at power failure without requiring user interaction
    n) The RPi system and internet performance and health must be monitored and logged

Nonfunctional requirements
    a) The embedded system must be designed with the main tenets of the Unix philosopy in mind
    b) Where appliable shell scipts should be used rather than other programming or scripting languages
    c) Either MQTT or ROS2 must be used as message passing system for the embedded linux
       system. All sensors, the pump actuator, the wireless remote functionality, the logic control
       etc. must be represented as message topics
    d) Where applicable the embedded system must be scalable towards handling multiple plants
       (disregarding the limitation of serial port interfaces).
    e) The RPi must to the extent possible be secured against malicious cyber attacks from both the
       internet connection, when active, and the local wifi
